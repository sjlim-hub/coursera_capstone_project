With over **7,000** restaurants present, the competition is incredible. \n\nAs a budding entrepreneur, **Client A** wishes to expand their growing franchise and setup a restaurant in the city of Chicago. There are several factors to choosing an ideal location:\n- Access to transportation\n- Nearby venues\n- Competition\n\n**Client A** has requested advice on choosing the best location for their restaurant. Using data science, I will examine neighborhoods around Chicago, Illinois and nearby venues to provide a suggestion for an ideal spot."

The resulting data will be mapped using matplotlib.\n* Libraries used, and previously mentioned, will be sourced from pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, matplotlib, and geopy.\n* Tables will be presented for any miscellaneous data which is not visualized."
