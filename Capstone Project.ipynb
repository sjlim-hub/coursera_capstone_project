With a large city comes a large population! With over **7,000** restaurants present, Chicago presents a ripe opportunity for businesses interested in the food service industry.\n\n[The National Restaurant Industry](https://restaurant.org/research/restaurant-statistics/restaurant-industry-facts-at-a-glance) indicates a projected restaurant industry revenue of nearly $899 billion for 2020. This indicates a growth of almost $36 billion compared to compared to 2019, according to their [factbook](https://www.restaurant.org/downloads/pdfs/research/soi/restaurant_industry_fact_sheet_2019.pdf). With continued projected growth, established and new restaurants may wish to expand their business to other locations.\n\nWith the above in mind, restaurateurs or franchise owners may wish to open up their business in the city of Chicago. However, there are several factors to choosing an ideal location:\n- Access to transportation\n- Nearby venues\n- Competition\n\nQuestions to be answered:\n- Are there specific neighborhoods in Chicago with easier access to transportation than others?\n- Which neighborhoods frequent restaurants?\n\nUsing data science, we will examine neighborhoods around Chicago, Illinois and nearby venues to provide a suggestion for an ideal spot."

The resulting data will be mapped using matplotlib.\n* Libraries used, and previously mentioned, will be sourced from pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, matplotlib, and geopy.\n* Tables will be presented for any miscellaneous data which is not visualized."
